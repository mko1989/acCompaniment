## Development


The application is built using Electron. Key technologies include:

*   **Electron:** For building the cross-platform desktop application.
*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For the user interface and core logic.
*   **Howler.js:** For audio playback.
*   **Node.js:** For main process logic and system interactions.
*   **WebSockets:** For communication with the Bitfocus Companion module.
*   **OSC (Open Sound Control):** For mixer integration.

### Project Structure

The project follows a standard Electron structure:
- `main.js` - Main Electron process
- `src/main/` - Main process modules
- `src/renderer/` - Renderer process (UI) modules
- `assets/` - Application icons and resources

### Available Scripts

*   `npm start` - Start the Electron application in development mode
*   `npm run pack` - Package the application (without creating installers)
*   `npm run dist` - Build distributables for all platforms
*   `npm run dist:mac` - Build macOS distributable
*   `npm run dist:win` - Build Windows distributable

### Building for Distribution

To create distributable packages:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for all platforms
npm run dist

# Or build for specific platform
npm run dist:mac    # macOS
npm run dist:win    # Windows
```

Built packages will be available in the `dist/` directory.

## Companion Module Integration

To control acCompaniment from Bitfocus Companion:

1.  Ensure acCompaniment is running. The internal WebSocket server will start automatically.
2.  Install the `companion-module-highpass-accompaniment` module into your Bitfocus Companion setup.
3.  Add an instance of the "acCompaniment" module in Companion.
4.  Configure the IP address and port if necessary (defaults usually work if Companion and acCompaniment are on the same machine).
5.  Actions, variables, and feedbacks will become available in Companion to control and monitor cues.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Audio not playing:**
- Check that the correct audio output device is selected in Settings
- Verify audio files are in supported formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.)

**Cues not appearing:**
- Ensure audio files are being dropped in the main grid area
- Check that files are not corrupted

**Remote control not working:**
- Verify HTTP remote control is enabled in Settings
- Check firewall settings if accessing from another device

**Performance issues:**
- Close unnecessary applications
- Reduce the number of simultaneous playing cues
- Use lower quality audio files if needed
